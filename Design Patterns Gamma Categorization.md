Design patterns are typically split into three categories ( called after Erich Gamma)

1. Creation Patterns
- Deal with creation (construction) of objects
- Explicit vs implicit
- Wholesale or piece-wise

2. Structural Patterns
- Class members
- Wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
- Importance of good API design

3. Behavioral Patterns
- No central theme
