## Problem solving approach

### Understand the problem

1. Can you restate the problem in your own words
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
4. Do you have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem


### Explore examples

- Start with simple examples
- Progress to more complex examples
- Explore examples with empty inputs
- Explore examples with invalid inputs


### Break it down

- Write down some general step, like a simple basic components to the solution
- Add and reiterate

### Solve or simplify

- Solve the problem if you can
- If you can't - simplify
- Find the core difficulty and ignore it
- Write a simplified solution
- Try to incorporate or tackle that difficulty with simplified solution
